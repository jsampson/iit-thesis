- for connectivity matrix, execute program for every possible input and collect
  a set of inputs for each instruction
  - for every instruction, there will be a partition of the bits into those
    that vary and those that don't
  - then check every SET/CLR instruction to see what bits vary in its set of
    inputs
  - remember that A[x] causes B[x] unless B[x] is definitely set or cleared
    without checking A[x]
  - and some instructions may never be reached for some inputs
